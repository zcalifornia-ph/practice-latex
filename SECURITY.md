# Security Policy

## Adaptation and Transparency Notice

This is an independent security policy for this repository.
It adapts publicly available principles from University of the Philippines (UP) documents, including the UP Quality Policy and the UP Statement of the Philosophy of Education and Graduate Attributes (approved November 28, 2019), to embody their spirit of quality, responsibility, and continuous improvement in an open-source setting.
This adaptation does not imply UP affiliation, adoption, sponsorship, or endorsement unless explicitly stated by repository maintainers.

## Security Principles

We treat security as part of quality.
Our approach emphasizes:

- responsible stewardship of user and contributor trust
- ethical, professional, and evidence-based issue handling
- inclusive and respectful collaboration during incident response
- continuous improvement through post-incident learning

## Supported Versions

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use coordinated disclosure.
Do not open public issues for suspected vulnerabilities.

Send reports to `zecalifornia@up.edu.ph` with:

- affected component, version, or file path
- reproduction steps or proof of concept
- impact assessment and severity estimate
- suggested mitigation or patch (optional)

If encrypted reporting is supported, document key-sharing instructions in this section.

## Response Targets

- acknowledgment within 72 hours
- initial triage within 7 calendar days
- best-effort remediation plan within 30 calendar days

Complex issues may require more time; we will provide status updates during triage and remediation.

## Safe Handling and Disclosure

- We will coordinate disclosure timing with the reporter after a fix or mitigation is available.
- We will credit reporters unless anonymity is requested.
- We ask reporters to avoid privacy violations, service disruption, or data destruction during testing.
